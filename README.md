# Regression-Analysis
This second project is a great companion to the first! While the first focused on **simulation**, this one focuses on **Empirical Analysis**. You are using multivariate regression to see how different financial ratios impact a company's capital structure (Gearing).

Here is a professional README template for this project:

# Financial Determinants of Capital Gearing: A Regression Analysis

This project performs a multivariate linear regression analysis to identify the key financial drivers behind corporate **Gearing** (leverage). Using data extracted from the **FAME database**, the model evaluates the predictive power of profitability and efficiency ratios on a firm's debt-to-equity structure.

## 📊 Regression Summary

The model analyzes 40 observations to determine the relationship between **Gearing** (Dependent Variable) and several independent variables:

* **ROCE** (Return on Capital Employed)
* **ROSF** (Return on Shareholders' Funds)
* **RTA** (Return on Total Assets)
* **Profit Margin**

### Key Statistics

* **R-Square:** 0.262 (Approximately **26.2%** of the variance in Gearing is explained by these four variables).
* **Significance F:** 3% (The overall model is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level).
* **Primary Driver:** **ROSF** is the most significant predictor with a P-value of **1%**.

## 📈 Visualizations Included

The repository contains four **Line Fit Plots** that compare actual Gearing data against the "Predicted Gearing" values generated by the model:

1. **ROSF Line Fit Plot:** Shows the strongest correlation among the variables.
2. **RTA Line Fit Plot**.
3. **PROFIT MARGIN Line Fit Plot**.
4. **ROCE Line Fit Plot**.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Tools

* **Data Source:** Extracted from FAME (Online Database), accessed June 2025.
* **Analysis Tool:** Microsoft Excel Data Analysis Toolpak (Regression Module).
* **Statistical Formula:**
  
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{ROCE}) + \beta_2(\text{ROSF}) + \beta_3(\text{RTA}) + \beta_4(\text{ProfitMargin}) + \epsilon$$

## 🔍 Analytical Insights

* **Inverse Relationship:** The coefficient for **ROSF** is **-4.44**, suggesting that as returns to shareholders increase, gearing tends to decrease (aligning with the Pecking Order Theory of finance).
* **Model Accuracy:** The **Standard Error of 140.9** and the R-Square value suggest that while these ratios are influential, there are other external factors not captured in this specific model that influence gearing decisions.

**Would you like me to suggest a repository name for this project as well, or perhaps a combined name if you plan to host both projects together?**
